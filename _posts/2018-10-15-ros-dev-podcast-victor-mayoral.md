The ROS Developers Podcast ([www.theconstructsim.com/category/ros_developers_podcast/](http://www.theconstructsim.com/category/ros_developers_podcast/)) was launched by [The Construct](http://www.theconstructsim.com/)'s CEO Ricardo Téllez. On a weekly to biweekly basis, he publishes a half-hour interview with developers from the ROS community.

In [**episode 25**](), from October 2018, Ricardo Téllez talked with Víctor Mayoral from Acutronic Robotics on ROS 2 and the Hardware Robot Operating System (or H-ROS), amongst others. Víctor introduced the importance of modularity and presented their current work with robot part manufacturers that aims to break the current lock-in in the robotics industry. Additionally, Víctor presented MARA, the first modular and collaborative industrial manipulator powered by ROS 2.
